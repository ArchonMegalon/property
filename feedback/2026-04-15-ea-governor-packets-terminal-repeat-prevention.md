# EA Governor Packets Terminal Repeat Prevention

Package: `next90-m106-ea-governor-packets`
Frontier: `1758984842`
Milestone: `106`

This pass verified the canonical successor registry, design queue row, Fleet queue mirror, EA packet artifacts, and direct proof runner still agree that the EA-owned surfaces are closed:

- `operator_packets:weekly_governor`
- `reporter_followthrough:release_truth`

No operator telemetry or active-run helper commands were invoked.

The closeout gap was not missing packet implementation. It was repeat behavior: the manifest had accumulated timestamp-only successor-wave verification notes for the same completed EA package. `SUCCESSOR_HANDOFF_CLOSEOUT.yaml` now records a terminal verification policy: once registry task `106.2`, both queue rows, completed outputs, proof artifacts, and `python tests/test_chummer_governor_packet_pack.py` still agree, a newer `ACTIVE_RUN_HANDOFF.generated.md` timestamp alone is not a reason to append another EA proof note.

Future reopen triggers are limited to real authority or proof drift: registry/queue package changes, packet artifact/test failure, or disappearance/drift of the guarded readiness, parity, feedback, or progress-mail anchors.

The 2026-04-15T16:18:44Z and 2026-04-15T16:22:46Z active-run handoffs were reviewed as the same closed package and frontier. They are covered by the terminal ignored-assignment rule, not recorded as successor-wave verification history, package proof, or per-handoff ignored-signal rows.
Later handoffs with the same package id and frontier id are handled the same way by policy without appending per-handoff manifest rows or ignored-assignment rows.

Proof:

- `python tests/test_chummer_governor_packet_pack.py` -> `ran=20 failed=0`
- `python -m py_compile tests/test_chummer_governor_packet_pack.py` -> pass
