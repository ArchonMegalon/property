Title: EA governor-packet successor-wave verification

Package: next90-m106-ea-governor-packets
Frontier: 1758984842

What shipped:
- Verified the package directly against the canonical successor registry and Fleet staging queue.
- Confirmed `NEXT_90_DAY_PRODUCT_ADVANCE_REGISTRY.yaml` keeps milestone `106` in progress while work task `106.2` is complete for `executive-assistant`.
- Confirmed the staging queue row is `status: complete`, still points at `executive-assistant`, and still limits this package to `skills`, `tests`, `feedback`, and `docs`.
- Confirmed the EA-local packet contract, specimens, README, handoff closeout, and prior feedback guard exist under the allowed paths.
- Re-ran the local proof boundary without operator telemetry or active-run helper commands.

Proof:
- `python tests/test_chummer_governor_packet_pack.py` exited 0 with `ran=17 failed=0`.
- `python -m py_compile tests/test_chummer_governor_packet_pack.py` exited 0.

What remains:
- No EA-owned work remains for `operator_packets:weekly_governor` or `reporter_followthrough:release_truth`.
- Remaining milestone `106` execution belongs to Fleet, Hub, Registry, and design sibling lanes.

Exact blocker:
- None inside the EA-owned package surfaces.
