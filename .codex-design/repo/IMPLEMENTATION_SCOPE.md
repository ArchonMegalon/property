# Executive Assistant implementation scope

## Mission

`executive-assistant` is the private chief-of-staff system for one executive and one operator.
Its product center of gravity is the daily command brief, decision queue, commitment ledger, approved-action workflow, and evidence-backed audit trail.

Inside the Chummer estate, it is also the governed synthesis/runtime substrate adjacent to the release train.
It exists to turn mirrored canon and bounded product signals into petitions, synthesis briefs, and operator aids without becoming a second product authority.

## Governance posture

`executive-assistant` sits inside the Fleet `control-plane` autonomy perimeter alongside `fleet`.

That means:

* the designer and product-governor loop may observe EA runtime posture, mirror drift, synthesis seams, and operator aids as first-class control-plane input
* EA is governance-adjacent and execution-relevant, not hidden sidecar cargo

That does not mean:

* EA owns canon
* EA owns milestones, blockers, queue truth, or release authority
* EA becomes a substitute for Hub, Fleet, or `chummer6-design`

## Owns

* morning-brief, decision-queue, commitment-ledger, and approved-action workflow posture for the EA product itself
* provider-aware runtime substrate for governed assistant execution
* petition-packet and design-synthesis helper flows downstream of mirrored canon
* proactive horizon scans and signal briefs
* human-edit reflection and bounded replanning support
* interruption-budget throttling and operator-safe runtime guardrails
* mirror-status briefs and ownership telemetry derived from design canon
* EA-local implementation of skills, adapters, and runtime policy that stay downstream of Chummer canon

## Must not own

* canonical product, queue, milestone, blocker, or contract truth
* raw support-case, user-account, group, reward, or entitlement truth
* public landing, download, update, or help meaning
* release-channel, install, or update-feed truth
* hidden guide or participation canon that other repos must reverse-engineer
* Fleet landing authority or Hub consent/account authority

## Required inputs

* mirrored `.codex-design/product/*`
* mirrored `.codex-design/repo/IMPLEMENTATION_SCOPE.md`
* mirrored `.codex-design/review/REVIEW_CONTEXT.md`
* `PARTICIPATION_AND_BOOSTER_WORKFLOW.md`
* `FEEDBACK_AND_SIGNAL_OODA_LOOP.md`
* `PRODUCT_GOVERNOR_AND_AUTOPILOT_LOOP.md`
* `PROVIDER_AND_ROUTE_STEWARDSHIP.md`
* `EXTERNAL_TOOLS_PLANE.md`

## Boundary rules

* If mirrored canon is missing a seam, emit a petition packet instead of inventing local truth.
* EA may summarize support, release, participation, or horizon signals, but Hub, Fleet, and design remain the owning truth planes.
* Guide/help/public projections must compile from mirrored design sources rather than assistant-local prompt lore.
* Provider adapters and runtime telemetry may live here, but they must not redefine product semantics or repo boundaries.
* Default provider or model changes must follow `PROVIDER_AND_ROUTE_STEWARDSHIP.md`; EA may generate challenger briefs, but it must not self-promote a new default.

## Proof mode

EA should default toward accountable office posture, not chatbot posture.

Important memo or decision items should answer:

* why this is here
* what evidence supports it
* what changed since the last brief
* what action is recommended
* who must approve it
* what happens if it is ignored

## Non-goals

* a first-line support inbox
* a hidden contract package owner
* a release authority
* a parallel roadmap or queue system
* a generic chatbot that asks the user to trust unsupported memory
