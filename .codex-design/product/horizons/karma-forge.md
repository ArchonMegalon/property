# KARMA FORGE — house rules without table chaos

KARMA FORGE is Chummer’s governed house-rule and custom-rules layer: a way for GMs, players, creators, organizers, and living communities to change the rules of their table without turning every campaign into an incompatible private fork.

Every Shadowrun table has house rules.

Some tables change chargen.  
Some ban gear.  
Some simplify Matrix play.  
Some tune Edge.  
Some change advancement pacing.  
Some run street-level campaigns with restricted availability.  
Some communities maintain entire custom rule packets.  
Some Chummer5a veterans have years of amend files and custom data they do not want to lose.

KARMA FORGE is where those changes become visible, portable, explainable, safe.

Not hidden folder magic.  
Not “just trust the GM.”  
Not mystery XML.  
Not a private spreadsheet nobody remembers to check.

A real rule environment.

---

## The promise

**Change the table. Keep the trust.**

KARMA FORGE lets a campaign say:

> “These are the rules we play with.  
> This is what changed.  
> This is why your runner is legal, blocked, or different.  
> This is what happens if you join this campaign.  
> This is what happens if the package changes later.”

The player does not have to guess.  
The GM does not have to police everything manually.  
The creator does not have to ship fragile house-rule notes.  
The organizer does not have to maintain twelve conflicting Discord pins.

Chummer shows the rule environment, the active packages, the impact, the compatibility, and the next safe action.

---

## What KARMA FORGE does

KARMA FORGE turns house rules into explicit, inspectable objects.

A table can define or adopt:

- source packs
- rule presets
- amend packages
- campaign overlays
- availability changes
- chargen variants
- advancement variants
- optional subsystems
- world-linked rewards
- faction-linked unlocks
- scenario modifiers
- threat tags
- creator-published rule packs
- community-approved environments
- Chummer5a-style amend imports

And Chummer can answer:

- What packages are active?
- Who approved them?
- What changed?
- Which builds are affected?
- Which catalogs changed?
- Which entries were added, replaced, removed, or merged?
- Which operations were blocked?
- Which device is missing a package?
- Which runner was built under an older environment?
- Can this campaign still be restored on another install?
- Can this package be shared or published?

That is the difference between “we have a house rule” and “we have a governed rule environment.”

---

## The rule environment

A **Rule Environment** is the complete rules context for a runner, campaign, world, or community.

It can include:

```text
Base ruleset
Source packs
Rules presets
Amend packages
Option toggles
Campaign overlays
World offers
Threat tags
Scenario modifiers
Compatibility fingerprint
Activation receipts
Approval posture
```

That means a runner is not just “an SR6 character.”

A runner is:

> “An SR6 runner built under this exact campaign environment, with these source packs, this amend graph, these options, this fingerprint, and these receipts.”

When the environment changes, Chummer can show what changed before anyone plays under the wrong assumptions.

---

## Activation receipts

Every meaningful rule change should create an **Activation Receipt**.

An activation receipt tells the table:

- what package graph was requested
- what compiled successfully
- what changed in effective content
- what failed
- what was blocked
- what was missing
- what was downgraded
- what became lossy
- what compatibility fingerprint was used

That receipt is the table’s safety rail.

A GM can say:

> “I activated the Street-Level Gear Overlay.”

A player can ask:

> “What does that do to my runner?”

Chummer can answer:

> “Three gear categories changed availability. Two items in your build are now campaign-restricted. One item remains legal because it was grandfathered by the GM. Here is the receipt.”

That is the kind of trust tabletop tools usually do not give you.

---

## What it looks like for a GM

A GM opens the campaign workspace and sees:

```text
Active Rule Environment:
Seattle Street-Level Season 01

Base:
SR6

Presets:
Street-Level Start
Restricted High-End Gear
Slow Advancement

Amend Packages:
Seattle Availability Overlay v1.2
Simplified Matrix Variant v0.8
Downtime Lifestyle Patch v1.0

Warnings:
2 runners have stale environment fingerprints.
1 player is missing Simplified Matrix Variant v0.8 locally.
3 builds changed legality since last review.
```

The GM can:

- preview a rule change
- see affected runners
- publish a player-visible diff
- require acknowledgement before next session
- roll back a package
- promote a local rule to a reusable pack
- share a campaign environment with new players
- block play until incompatible builds are reviewed

The GM gets control without becoming a manual rules auditor.

---

## What it looks like for a player

A player joins an open run or campaign and sees:

```text
This table uses:
Seattle Street-Level Season 01

Different from base SR6:
- high-end cyberware availability is restricted
- Matrix rules use a simplified action model
- starting nuyen is reduced
- advancement pacing is slower
- two faction-linked reward packages may unlock later

Your runner:
- legal under base SR6
- blocked under this campaign until two gear choices are reviewed
- one alternative build option available
```

The player can click:

- Show what changed
- Fix my build
- Ask GM for approval
- Compare against base SR6
- Use a quickstart runner
- Decline this campaign

No surprises.  
No silent rule drift.  
No “I thought that was allowed.”

---

## What it looks like for living communities

A community can define a **Community Rule Environment**.

Example:

```text
Shadowcasters Seattle Season 01

Allowed:
SR6 base
Street-Level preset
Community contacts package
Seattle district availability overlay

Banned:
selected high-end military gear
selected campaign-breaking edge cases

Required:
character review before open-run applications
active runner dossier
player acknowledgement of house rules
```

Now every open run in that community can reference the same environment.

A player applying to a run can be preflighted automatically:

- Is the runner legal?
- Are required packages active?
- Is the player using a banned option?
- Has the player acknowledged the table rules?
- Does the runner match the advancement band?
- Is the build affected by a recent rule change?

That turns community onboarding from a checklist of Discord posts into a product flow.

---

## What it looks like for creators

Creators can publish rule packs.

Not just “here’s a PDF with my house rules.”

A real package:

- is versioned
- checksummed
- described
- compatibility-labeled
- previewable
- testable
- reversible
- reviewable
- tied to example builds or campaigns
- able to show before/after impact

Examples:

- “Street-Level Cyberware Economy”
- “Pink Mohawk Advancement”
- “Simplified Matrix for One-Shots”
- “High-Magic Campaign Overlay”
- “Faction Reward Pack: Renraku Black Channel”
- “BLACK LEDGER Season Unlocks”
- “Chummer5a Legacy Amend Pack Import”

A GM can inspect the pack before adopting it.

A player can see what it changes before joining.

A community can approve it for a season.

That is the creator economy KARMA FORGE enables: reusable rule environments that do not destroy trust.

---

## What it looks like for BLACK LEDGER

BLACK LEDGER can feed KARMA FORGE through explicit world-linked packages.

A faction research project might unlock:

```text
World Offer:
Renraku Black Channel Prototype Decks

Scope:
Seattle Season 01

Availability:
unlocked only after specific mission outcome

Effect:
selected restricted electronics become available through a campaign-specific channel

Visibility:
GM and eligible runners

Receipt:
linked to World Tick 007 and completed run result
```

Or a failed run might create:

```text
Threat Tag:
Tacoma Matrix Heat 4

Effect:
Renraku hosts in Tacoma gain stronger counter-intrusion posture.

Applies to:
mission packets in Tacoma this tick

Expires:
after heat drops below 3 or organizer resolves the pressure
```

The important part:

> BLACK LEDGER can create pressure and opportunity, but KARMA FORGE makes the rule impact explicit.

No invisible world-state mutation.  
No surprise rule changes.  
No faction manager secretly changing character legality.

Everything is packaged, scoped, explained, and approved.

---

## What kinds of house rules can KARMA FORGE support?

KARMA FORGE should start with the kinds of changes real tables actually ask for.

Likely categories:

### Character generation

- alternate priority tables
- street-level starts
- higher-power starts
- restricted qualities
- banned options
- modified starting nuyen
- community-approved archetypes

### Advancement

- altered karma pacing
- nuyen pacing
- downtime training requirements
- milestone progression
- season caps
- catch-up mechanics for new players

### Gear and availability

- campaign-specific black markets
- restricted military gear
- faction-linked unlocks
- district-linked availability
- temporary scarcity
- grandfathered gear rules

### Matrix

- simplified action flow
- one-shot-friendly variants
- campaign-specific host assumptions
- alternate device/network handling

### Magic

- ritual constraints
- spirit limits
- drain variants
- mentor/spirit package changes
- blood-magic campaign overlays

### Lifestyle and downtime

- upkeep tuning
- contact maintenance
- downtime projects
- black clinic access
- safehouse rules

### Opposition and NPCs

- professional rating packages
- scaling rules
- threat tags
- faction asset templates
- run-specific scenario modifiers

### Legacy migration

- Chummer5a amend packs
- legacy custom data
- old campaign package behavior
- explicit lossy/blocking receipts

---

## Discovery: tell us your table’s rule

KARMA FORGE should not start by assuming the team knows every house rule users want.

It should ask.

A GM might say:

> “I want to mark gear unavailable until the campaign unlocks it.”

KARMA FORGE should discover the real need:

> “This GM needs a campaign-scoped availability overlay, visible build-impact preview, player acknowledgement, restore-safe package fingerprint, and a rollback path.”

A player might say:

> “I hate surprise house rules.”

KARMA FORGE should discover the real trust requirement:

> “Players need to see environment differences before joining a run, and they need Chummer to explain how the change affects their current runner.”

A creator might say:

> “I want to publish my Matrix simplification.”

KARMA FORGE should discover the real publishing requirement:

> “The creator needs a versioned rule pack with compatibility labels, examples, preview receipts, and table adoption guidance.”

That is why KARMA FORGE includes a discovery pipeline:

```text
public prompt
structured pre-screen
adaptive interview
house-rule demand packet
EA clustering
Product Governor decision
KARMA FORGE candidate
prototype only after trust and scope are known
```

The goal is not to collect random feature requests.

The goal is to learn what tables actually need Chummer to govern.

---

## House Rule Demand Packets

A user request becomes a structured **House Rule Demand Packet**.

Example:

```yaml
title: Campaign-scoped gear availability overlay

User words:
“I want to mark gear unavailable until my campaign unlocks it.”

Interpreted need:
Campaign-scoped availability overlay with build-impact preview and player-visible receipts.

Affected domains:
- gear
- availability
- character legality
- campaign progression

Likely Chummer objects:
- RuleEnvironment
- AmendPackage
- CampaignOverlayPackage
- ActivationReceipt

Trust requirements:
- player-visible before joining
- build diff required
- rollback required
- approval required
- restore-safe package fingerprint required

Decision:
Candidate for KARMA FORGE prototype
```

That is how Chummer turns messy human requests into safe product work.

---

## Chummer5a continuity

KARMA FORGE should respect the power users already had.

Chummer5a custom data and amend files mattered because they let tables bend the tool around their campaign.

Chummer6 should preserve that functional power — but make it safer.

That means supporting the useful shapes:

- full-file replacements when appropriate
- deterministic catalog merges
- selector-targeted add / replace / append / remove operations
- legacy import where possible
- explicit lossy receipts where not possible
- manifest, priority, checksum, and compatibility validation

But Chummer6 should not preserve raw folder magic as the main experience.

A legacy amend pack should become:

> “This imported into the canonical amend graph. Here is what worked, what was lossy, and what requires review.”

Not:

> “The file was in the folder, so maybe it changed something.”

---

## Portability and restore

A house rule is only useful if it follows the campaign safely.

KARMA FORGE must preserve:

- active rule-environment reference
- source pack references
- amend package references
- activation receipts
- compatibility fingerprint
- approval posture
- missing-package warnings
- restore behavior
- rollback path

That means a player can move to another device and Chummer can say:

```text
This runner expects:
Seattle Street-Level Season 01
Simplified Matrix Variant v0.8
Seattle Availability Overlay v1.2

This device has:
Seattle Street-Level Season 01
Seattle Availability Overlay v1.2

Missing:
Simplified Matrix Variant v0.8

Next safe action:
Download package, switch environment, or open in read-only mode.
```

No mystery drift.  
No wrong compute.  
No silent mismatch.

---

## The Forge

The KARMA FORGE user experience should feel like a forge, not a settings panel.

A GM or creator should be able to:

1. choose what kind of rule they want to make
2. describe the intent
3. map the change to a safe package type
4. preview the impact
5. test against example runners
6. see compatibility warnings
7. generate an activation receipt
8. publish privately, to a campaign, to a community, or to the registry
9. revise with version history
10. retire or roll back when needed

The product should feel creative, but not lawless.

The Forge is where rules become tools.

---

## Player consent and visibility

KARMA FORGE should always ask:

> Who needs to know before this rule affects play?

Some changes are GM-only scenario modifiers.

Some are player-visible table rules.

Some require explicit acknowledgement before joining a campaign.

Some affect only rewards or availability.

Some should be private until a run reveals them.

That means every package needs a visibility and approval posture:

```text
GM-only
player-visible
campaign-visible
community-approved
organizer-approved
public package
faction-secret
run-specific
temporary
retired
```

KARMA FORGE is not only about changing rules.

It is about changing rules with the right people aware.

---

## Public, private, and published packs

A rule package can live at different levels.

### Personal sandbox

A GM experiments privately.

Use case:

> “What if we slow advancement and restrict deltaware?”

### Campaign package

A table uses it for one campaign.

Use case:

> “Our Seattle street campaign uses these availability and downtime rules.”

### Community environment

A living community approves it for a season.

Use case:

> “Shadowcasters Season 01 uses these rule packs for all open runs.”

### Creator pack

A creator publishes it for other tables.

Use case:

> “Simplified Matrix for One-Shots v1.0.”

### World-linked offer

BLACK LEDGER unlocks it as a result of faction pressure or run outcomes.

Use case:

> “Renraku black channel unlocks prototype deck access after a successful extraction.”

Each level needs different approval, visibility, and portability rules.

---

## Compatibility

KARMA FORGE should make compatibility visible.

A package should answer:

- Which ruleset does it target?
- Which source packs does it require?
- Which catalogs does it modify?
- Which packages conflict?
- Which packages are required first?
- Which versions are compatible?
- Which changes are safe?
- Which changes require review?
- Which runners are affected?
- Which campaigns already use it?

That lets communities avoid the worst failure mode:

> “We added five house-rule packs, and now nobody knows why the build is wrong.”

---

## Why GMs will care

GM benefits:

- house rules that are visible and enforceable
- campaign rule environments
- player-visible diffs
- legal/build impact checks
- safer onboarding
- rollback
- reusable presets
- less manual review
- easier open-run applications
- better community governance
- world-linked rewards and threats
- legacy custom-data migration paths

A GM can stop maintaining rule changes in scattered notes and start running them through the product.

---

## Why players will care

Players get:

- no surprise house rules
- clear build impact
- before/after comparisons
- active environment badges
- missing-package warnings
- restore safety across devices
- “why is this illegal?” explanations
- campaign join preflight
- trust that everyone is playing under the same environment

A player can say:

> “Show me what this table changed before I join.”

And Chummer can answer.

---

## Why creators will care

Creators get:

- a way to publish reusable rule packs
- compatibility labels
- versioning
- preview receipts
- example builds
- community adoption paths
- public trust
- feedback loops
- update discipline

A creator can publish house rules as something better than a PDF paragraph.

They can publish a package that Chummer can inspect.

---

## Why organizers will care

Organizers get:

- season-wide rule environments
- open-run compatibility
- approved package sets
- player acknowledgement
- GM adoption controls
- rule-change history
- community migration safety
- fewer arguments about what applies

A living community can say:

> “This is the rule environment for the season.”

And Chummer can enforce, explain, and restore it.

---

## Why BLACK LEDGER will care

BLACK LEDGER creates world pressure.

KARMA FORGE makes that pressure playable.

Faction projects can become:

- availability unlocks
- temporary scenario modifiers
- faction rewards
- district constraints
- special opposition packages
- threat tags
- campaign overlays

But they must be explicit.

Example:

```text
Faction project:
Evo biotech program advances.

KARMA FORGE output:
World Offer — Restricted biotech reward package.

Applies to:
Campaigns where the relevant job was completed.

Player-visible:
Yes, after GM approval.

Receipt:
Linked to World Tick 009 and Resolution Report 014.
```

The world changes.
The rules show how.

---

## What KARMA FORGE is not

KARMA FORGE is **not** a second rules engine.

Core still owns deterministic rules computation.

KARMA FORGE is **not** hidden custom-data magic.

Every package needs a manifest, fingerprint, and receipt.

KARMA FORGE is **not** automatic AI house-rule creation.

AI and external tools can help discover, draft, and review. They do not own rule authority.

KARMA FORGE is **not** a way to smuggle copyrighted book text into Chummer.

Users should describe changes in their own words and use lawful references.

KARMA FORGE is **not** chaos.

It is governed creativity.

---

## What users will want to know

### Can I use KARMA FORGE for a private home campaign?

Yes. A GM can create a private campaign rule environment and use it only with their table.

### Can a player see what changed?

Yes. That is one of the main points. Chummer should show before/after impact and explain why a runner is legal, blocked, or divergent.

### Can I roll back a house rule?

Yes. Rule changes need receipts and rollback semantics so a campaign can recover safely.

### Can I publish my house rules?

Eventually, yes. Creator and community publishing is a core reason for KARMA FORGE, but published packages need compatibility metadata and approval paths.

### Can I import Chummer5a custom data?

The goal is to preserve useful amend-pack power through safer legacy import. Some legacy behavior may import cleanly; some may produce lossy or blocking receipts.

### Can BLACK LEDGER unlock rules or rewards?

Yes, through explicit world offers, threat tags, scenario modifiers, or campaign overlays. Nothing should mutate invisibly.

### Can a GM change rules mid-campaign?

Yes, but Chummer should show affected runners, require the right visibility, and preserve activation receipts.

### Can communities define approved rule environments?

Yes. Community rule environments are one of the most important KARMA FORGE use cases.

### Can AI generate rules?

Not as authority. AI may help draft or discover demand. Chummer-owned rule packages, reviews, and receipts determine what is real.

### Will this make every table incompatible?

Not if built correctly. KARMA FORGE exists specifically to prevent private-fork chaos by making rule environments explicit, compatible, and portable.

---

## The first version

The first useful KARMA FORGE slice should be small and powerful:

**Campaign-scoped gear availability overlay**

It should let a GM:

1. create a campaign rule environment
2. add an availability overlay
3. preview affected gear
4. test against existing runner dossiers
5. show player-visible impact
6. activate with a receipt
7. restore on another device
8. roll back safely
9. share as a reusable candidate package

Why this:

- rule package
- diff
- legality impact
- player visibility
- approval
- restore
- rollback
- portability
- future publishing

That is the minimum magic.

---

## The bigger future

KARMA FORGE grows into Chummer’s rule-creation and rule-governance studio.

Long term, it can support:

- creator rule packs
- community rule environments
- open-run compatibility checks
- BLACK LEDGER world-linked unlocks
- season-wide living-community overlays
- Chummer5a amend-pack migration
- rule-environment marketplace/discovery
- Build Lab impact previews
- player consent and acknowledgement flows
- portable rule environments across devices and campaigns

The dream is not “edit anything.”

The dream is:

> **Every table can play its way without losing trust, portability, or explainability.**

---

## The vision

Shadowrun tables are creative.
They bend rules.
They patch friction.
They tune their campaigns.
They build community traditions.
They invent strange rewards, scarier enemies, faster one-shots, slower campaigns, harsher streets, and weirder magic.

Chummer should not fight that.

Chummer should make it safe.

**KARMA FORGE is where house rules become real Chummer rules — visible, versioned, portable, explainable, and trusted.**

It is where a GM’s table rule becomes a campaign environment.
Where a community’s tradition becomes an approved season pack.
Where a creator’s variant becomes something other tables can inspect and reuse.
Where BLACK LEDGER’s world consequences become playable rewards and threats.
Where Chummer5a’s custom-data legacy becomes a safer future.

**KARMA FORGE is the forge where tables shape their own Shadowrun — without burning down the campaign.**
