# RUNSITE

## The problem

GMs spend too long describing spaces, and players still misread compounds, clubs, hotels, museums, arcologies, and safehouses once the action starts.

## What it would do

Chummer would publish explorable location packs linked to mission briefings.
They could include floor plans, hotspots, route overlays, optional narration, and static map context, but they stay focused on helping you understand the space before the run starts, not on replacing live combat tools or a VTT.
RUNSITE is for briefing, planning, and spatial understanding before things go loud.

## Likely owners

* `chummer6-hub`
* `chummer6-media-factory`

## Key tool posture

* `Crezlo Tours` - primary explorable-tour lane
* `AvoMap` - route and location visualization support
* `PeekShot` - preview/share-card adapter
* `vidBoard` - bounded orientation-host and walkthrough clip lane
* `Soundmadeseen` - optional narration layer
* `BrowserAct` - bounded operator automation and capture fallback

## What has to be true first

* clean media manifests
* permissioned publication links
* preview and embed receipts
* reliable map and render adapters

## Current proof posture

RUNSITE is still a horizon, but it already has first-party preview proof in the public artifact registry through runsite-pack framing and route-oriented artifact language.
The spatial lane should now read as an inspectable preview path, not a blank future tease.
Route overlays, pack inspection, and explorable tours remain the first-party truth surfaces; host clips stay secondary orientation siblings rather than tactical authority.
The signed-in command lane is already live at `https://chummer.run/runsites`.
That lane currently carries first-party runsite packs on real markdown and JSON routes without pretending the whole spatial roadmap is done.

## Why it is not ready yet

The new vendor path makes this more plausible, but Chummer still needs a reliable permission model and clear evidence links before it should present RUNSITE as a real feature.
