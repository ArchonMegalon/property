# BLACK LEDGER — the city keeps scheming

**BLACK LEDGER is Chummer’s living-world layer: a persistent Shadowrun power struggle where megacorps, factions, GMs, players, runners, organizers, creators, and community organizers all push on the same city — and the city pushes back.**

Chummer already helps you build runners, explain rules, manage campaigns, and publish artifacts. BLACK LEDGER goes one level higher:

> **What if the world between runs was alive?**  
> What if every completed run changed the map?  
> What if player-submitted intel became future mission hooks?  
> What if megacorps had goals, budgets, rivalries, secrets, and propaganda?  
> What if GMs could open the job board and see runs that emerged from real faction pressure?

BLACK LEDGER is where that happens.

It is not just a random mission generator. It is a **living mission market**, **world map**, **faction engine**, **intel network**, and **campaign memory layer** for Chummer.

---

## The promise

**The city remembers what happened.**

A crew sabotages a Renraku shipment. Tacoma heat rises. A district marker changes. A faction newsletter goes out. A newsreel spins the story. A rival corp sees an opening. A GM gets three new job seeds. A faction manager decides whether to retaliate, hide the damage, or sponsor a deniable counter-run.

That is BLACK LEDGER.

Every world tick turns player action, GM resolution, faction pressure, and community lore into new opportunities.

---

## How it works

BLACK LEDGER runs on a simple loop:

```text
factions create pressure
players and GMs report intelligence
world ticks process the city state
GM receives mission opportunities
runs are scheduled and played
results are reported
the map changes
newsreels and faction briefings publish the fallout
the next tick starts from the new reality
```

The result is a Shadowrun world that feels less like a static backdrop and more like a living machine.

---

## The world map

BLACK LEDGER gives each active Chummer world a map.

The map can show:

* **planned runs**
* **completed runs**
* **district heat**
* **faction activity**
* **public rumors**
* **GM-only intel**
* **player-submitted leads**
* **news events**
* **unresolved consequences**
* **open opportunities**
* **world-tick changes**

A marker is never just a pin. It points back to a source: a run, a faction move, an intel report, a resolution report, a world tick, a news item, or a mission packet.

Click a marker and you can see what it means:

* Why is this district hot?
* Which faction is involved?
* Is this public, GM-only, or faction-secret?
* Did this come from a completed run?
* Can this become a mission?
* Is there a briefing, recap, or newsreel attached?
* What happens if a GM adopts this job?

The map becomes a campaign memory board, mission marketplace, and living city dashboard at the same time.

---

## The Mission Market

BLACK LEDGER gives GMs a better starting point than a blank page.

Instead of asking, “What should I run tonight?” the GM can open the Mission Market and see jobs generated from the world itself:

* a corp feud
* a failed extraction
* a player-submitted rumor
* a faction research project
* rising district heat
* a rival operation
* an unresolved campaign consequence
* a public scandal
* an occult clock
* a black-market opportunity

Each mission seed can include:

* sponsor
* target
* district
* heat profile
* recommended runner roles
* reward hooks
* likely opposition
* success consequences
* failure consequences
* connected factions
* player-safe pitch
* GM-only notes
* optional briefing packet
* optional runsite packet
* optional generated news hook

Example:

```text
Extraction at the Black Clinic

District: Redmond
Sponsor: Evo deniable channel
Target: unaffiliated biotech lab
Heat: high occult, medium security, low public
Tags: extraction, biotech, moral pressure, black clinic

Reward hooks:
- restricted biotech access
- contact trust with an Evo researcher

Failure consequences:
- occult heat rises
- Aztechnology blood cell becomes active
- local clinic network goes underground

Origin:
This job emerged from a player intel report, an Evo research project, and a failed prior run.
```

The GM can adopt it, edit it, schedule it, fork it, reject it, or ask Chummer for variants.

BLACK LEDGER suggests.
The GM decides.

---

## Open Runs and the Open Runs Board

A GM can turn a mission into an **Open Run**.

That run can appear on the world map or the Open Runs board with a player-safe listing:

* title
* pitch
* expected tone
* required ruleset
* house rules
* needed roles
* beginner friendliness
* schedule options
* language
* voice/video/text expectations
* content notes
* join policy
* Discord, Teams, or meeting handoff
* whether Table Pulse / GOD Observer is allowed

Players can request to join with one of their runner dossiers.

Chummer can preflight the application:

* Is the runner legal for this rule environment?
* Does the schedule fit?
* Does the table need this role?
* Are there unresolved character conflicts?
* Is the player using a quickstart runner?
* Did they acknowledge the table contract?
* Does the GM require approval?

A GM might define policies like:

```text
Beginner-friendly one-shot
5 seats
1 Matrix role preferred
Voice required
Discord handoff
Pregens allowed
House rules visible before joining
GOD Observer disabled unless everyone opts in
```

After the GM accepts players, Chummer can route them to the right place: Discord, Teams, a calendar booking, a campaign workspace, or another meeting surface.

Chummer does not replace your table tools.
It makes the table flow structured, visible, and remembered.

---

## Faction promo rails

BLACK LEDGER is not only a map and a board. It also has public-safe faction promo rails that show how each banner sells itself to the city.

Use them when you want the theatrical layer instead of the dry faction file:

* [Ashline Circle promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/ashline-circle/promo)
* [Neon Docks Union promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/neon-docks-union/promo)
* [Ghostline Network promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/ghostline-network/promo)
* [Barrens Free Wardens promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/barrens-free-wardens/promo)
* [Glass Tower Compact promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/glass-tower-compact/promo)
* [Rust Market Syndicate promo](https://chummer.run/ledger/factions/rust-market-syndicate/promo)

Each promo rail is supposed to feel like a recruitment bulletin with receipts, not a soft teaser:

* a first-party motion-video file
* captions

## Black Ledger Newsroom

BLACK LEDGER now also has a dedicated newsroom lane.

The newsroom is not allowed to behave like a generic motion-card teaser. It must stay downstream of Chummer-owned receipts and, at flagship quality, ship as a real broadcast-style bulletin with:

* a believable host
* B-roll or geoscape inserts
* lower thirds and ticker
* captions
* public-safety disclosure
* linked source receipts

The canonical newsroom bar lives in:

* `BLACK_LEDGER_NEWSROOM_CANON.md`
* `BLACK_LEDGER_ANCHOR_BIBLE.yaml`
* `BLACK_LEDGER_BROADCAST_STYLE_GUIDE.md`
* `BLACK_LEDGER_NEWSROOM_EDITORIAL_POLICY.md`
* `BLACK_LEDGER_NEWSROOM_QUALITY_GATES.yaml`

If those gates are not met, the result is a preview or fallback artifact, not a flagship Black Ledger bulletin.
* a route-backed JSON brief
* a storyboard fallback
* a validation route back into the ledger

That is the line BLACK LEDGER tries to hold everywhere: it is allowed to look dramatic, but it is not allowed to outrun proof.

---

## Session planning with Lunacal

GMs can schedule sessions around a run.

A GM adopts a job, picks “Schedule,” and Chummer can hand the session planning flow to Lunacal or another scheduling provider.

The scheduled session can then appear in Chummer as:

* planned run marker
* player RSVP state
* roster status
* readiness checklist
* pre-session packet
* meeting handoff
* rule-environment warnings
* Table Pulse consent state
* post-session resolution reminder

The calendar owns the booking.
Chummer owns the run.

If the session is rescheduled, Chummer updates the run marker.
If it is cancelled, no world result is recorded.
If it is played, the GM can file a resolution report and the city can change.

---

## Run results feed the world

After a run, the GM files a result:

* success
* failure
* mixed result
* collateral damage
* faction impact
* contacts gained or burned
* heat changes
* rewards unlocked
* unresolved consequences
* player-safe recap
* GM-only notes

A completed run might:

* raise district heat
* unlock a new faction asset
* damage a corp project
* expose a secret
* trigger a news story
* create a revenge job
* change a black-market channel
* make a runner notorious
* alter faction standings
* open or close future mission types

The run does not disappear after the table ends.
It becomes part of the world.

---

## Intelligence reports: bring your own lore

BLACK LEDGER lets users feed their own table lore into their Chummer world.

Players, GMs, creators, organizers, and faction managers can submit intelligence:

* rumors
* district lore
* suspicious faction activity
* unresolved NPC hooks
* black-market chatter
* contact reports
* campaign fallout
* failed-run consequences
* “we want more of this” signals
* local table legends
* faction secrets
* creator mission seeds

Example:

```text
Intel Report:
“Our table has been treating the old arcade in Redmond as a drone chop shop. We never resolved who owns it.”

Tags:
Redmond, drones, black market, Renraku, street-level

Desired use:
job generation, district lore, rumor, future run hook
```

A curator, GM, organizer, or world operator can review it.

Intel can become:

* a rumor
* a map marker
* a district activity note
* a job seed
* a news item
* a faction pressure lead
* a creator prompt
* a private campaign-only hook

It does not become canon automatically.

That is the key trust rule:

> **User lore is fuel. Chummer still requires review before it becomes world truth.**

This lets tables contribute without letting the world collapse into chaos.

---

## Factions and megacorps

BLACK LEDGER can model factions as active powers.

A faction is not just a name on a job. It can have:

* resources
* goals
* heat
* assets
* research projects
* rivalries
* secrets
* public posture
* private operations
* district influence
* special rewards
* signature threats

Factions can include megacorps, syndicates, cults, governments, NGOs, gangs, magical societies, fixers’ networks, or original table factions.

Each one can feel different.

Examples:

### Renraku

* host lockdowns
* drone suppression
* red-samurai response
* matrix escalation
* facility containment

### Aztechnology

* blood rituals
* public charity cover
* occult escalation
* sacrificial cells
* moral-pressure jobs

### Horizon

* reputation warfare
* public narrative control
* social media flooding
* charity masks
* propaganda spins

### Evo

* biotech prototypes
* black clinics
* transhuman experiments
* medical extraction jobs
* restricted ware access

### Saeder-Krupp

* acquisition pressure
* legal intimidation
* elite assets
* dragon-scale politics
* long games

Factions should not feel interchangeable.
The job board should make you feel who is moving.

---

## Faction managers

For advanced campaigns, seasons, or community play, BLACK LEDGER can let trusted users operate faction seats.

A faction manager might allocate resources each turn:

* capital
* influence
* matrix
* security
* arcana
* research

They can submit operation intents:

* sponsor a run
* suppress heat
* target a rival
* advance research
* seed disinformation
* secure a district
* open a black-market channel
* unlock a special asset
* escalate occult pressure

Example:

```text
Aztechnology faction manager:
- spends arcana on a ritual project
- spends influence to hide public attention
- targets a rival Evo clinic

World tick result:
- occult heat rises in Puyallup
- public heat stays low
- GM job seed generated: “Sabotage the ritual supply chain”
- failure consequence: blood-mage response cell unlocks
```

Faction managers are not there to “win Chummer.”
They are there to make the world more interesting.

The best faction move is one that creates a run someone wants to play.

---

## Heat

Heat is the pressure system.

BLACK LEDGER can track different kinds of heat:

* **crew heat** — how visible a runner crew is
* **district heat** — how tense a region is
* **sponsor heat** — how much scrutiny a faction draws
* **public heat** — media, legal, and political attention
* **matrix heat** — data-security response
* **security heat** — physical lockdown and counter-force
* **occult heat** — astral, ritual, and magical pressure

Heat creates consequences.

High matrix heat might generate:

* stronger hosts
* counter-decker squads
* IC escalation
* Renraku response teams
* data-theft counter-runs

High occult heat might generate:

* ritual clocks
* watcher spirits
* blood-magic rumors
* talismonger panic
* astral hazard jobs

High public heat might generate:

* news scandals
* corporate denials
* PR jobs
* legal pressure
* media manipulation

Heat makes the world react.

---

## Newsreels and city tickers

The world should talk back.

After a world tick or completed run, BLACK LEDGER can generate public-safe news:

```text
Tacoma Port Authority denies drone lockdown rumors

Officials call the shutdown routine maintenance after witnesses report Renraku-marked security drones near a restricted warehouse.
```

Or:

```text
Horizon announces relief campaign after unexplained Redmond clinic fire

Local witnesses say armed responders arrived before emergency services. Horizon denies any corporate security involvement.
```

News can become:

* city ticker text
* campaign news feed
* faction newsletter
* GM-only briefing
* player-safe recap
* vidBoard news anchor reel
* Taja short
* PeekShot card
* MarkupGo bulletin
* Signitic email banner

The same event can have multiple versions:

* public rumor
* player-safe recap
* GM spoiler packet
* faction-secret briefing
* organizer summary

That means Chummer can show the world differently depending on who is looking.

---

## Faction newsletters

Factions can publish their own internal or public-facing updates.

A faction newsletter might include:

* current objectives
* heat warnings
* active assets
* rival activity
* public narrative wins
* sponsored job outcomes
* available rewards
* research progress
* faction-seat orders
* propaganda lines

Examples:

### Renraku Internal Dispatch

```text
Grid exposure in Tacoma exceeded tolerance.
Counter-intrusion audit authorized.
Runner involvement suspected.
Red Samurai deployment remains deniable.
```

### Horizon Public Bulletin

```text
Horizon Community Forward announces emergency support in Redmond following infrastructure disruption.
Rumors of corporate activity remain unverified and irresponsible.
```

### Aztechnology Occult Desk

```text
Ritual supply chain interrupted.
Secondary cell activated.
Public-facing charity cover remains intact.
Astral heat acceptable.
```

Faction newsletters give the world identity.
They also make faction managers and players care about more than numbers.

---

## Table Pulse and GOD Observer

BLACK LEDGER can integrate with Table Pulse — carefully, and with the rail split kept explicit.

Table Pulse Live is not live surveillance.
Table Pulse Aftermath is not player scoring.
Neither rail is moderation truth.
Neither rail is automatic world truth.

With consent, Table Pulse Aftermath or a GOD Observer lane can help after a session:

* summarize what happened
* identify unresolved objectives
* suggest recap points
* help draft a resolution report
* highlight pacing or spotlight notes
* prepare GM-private coaching
* generate a player-safe recap

A GM might finish a session and see:

```text
Suggested resolution notes:
- Team extracted the target.
- Public heat remained low.
- Matrix heat increased after failed host cleanup.
- Player intel about the black clinic should become corroborated.
- Evo sponsor trust +1.
- Aztechnology occult heat +1.
```

The GM still approves the result.

The world changes only after an authorized human confirms it.

Table Pulse Live is a separate rail. It handles in-world heat packets, bounded remote reactions,
and GM adjudication during play or immediate aftermath. Table Pulse Aftermath handles the private
coaching, recap, and debrief side.

---

## Reputation and seasonal honors

BLACK LEDGER can also make contribution visible.

Not a toxic permanent leaderboard.
Not “best user wins.”
Not public shame.

Instead: seasonal honors, reputation, street cred, notoriety, faction momentum, and runner legends.

Possible honors:

### GMs

* Reliable Fixer
* Beginner Table Hero
* Best BLACK LEDGER Closeout
* Best Recap Delivery
* Creator Playtest Host

### Players

* Always Ready
* Team Glue
* Good Debriefer
* Rookie Runner
* Clean Comms

### Runners

* Heat Magnet
* Cleanest Ghost
* Corp Problem
* Street Legend
* Best Dramatic Escape

### Intel contributors

* Fixer’s Source
* District Chronicler
* Rumor Became Real
* Newsroom Source

### Factions

* Most Deniable Successes
* Public Narrative Winner
* Best Heat Management
* Most Chaotic Quarter

### Faction managers

* Best Schemer
* Job Market Maker
* Rivalry Builder
* Clockmaker

The goal is not to rank everyone forever.

The goal is:

> **The world remembers who made things happen.**

---

## Why GMs will care

BLACK LEDGER gives GMs:

* mission seeds with context
* world pressure they can use
* a map of active consequences
* player applications and join policies
* scheduling support
* run result reporting
* newsreel generation
* faction-driven plot hooks
* player-submitted intel
* ready-made escalation from previous runs

It reduces blank-page prep while keeping GM authority intact.

The GM remains the table’s creative owner.
BLACK LEDGER gives them a city that keeps offering trouble.

---

## Why players will care

Players get:

* runs they can discover and apply for
* visible table rules before joining
* runner dossiers tied to actual world outcomes
* news about what their crew changed
* reputation and legend moments
* a way to submit intel and lore
* player-safe recaps
* campaign continuity
* a sense that their character did something that mattered

A player can look at the map and say:

> “That marker exists because of our run.”

That is powerful.

---

## Why organizers will care

Organizers can run:

* shared city campaigns
* open-run networks
* public seasons
* faction events
* living-community arcs
* creator playtests
* seasonal honors
* world tick schedules
* GM onboarding programs

Discord can host the conversation.
Foundry or Roll20 can host the table.
Lunacal can schedule the time.
Chummer owns the world memory.

---

## Why creators will care

Creators can publish:

* mission packets
* faction arcs
* runsite packs
* campaign primers
* newsreel kits
* rule-environment packs
* faction newsletters
* season modules
* BLACK LEDGER-ready adventures

A creator’s module can become part of the mission market.

A published job can be adopted by GMs, played by tables, resolved into world state, and surfaced in recaps and seasonal honors.

That turns creator content from static PDF into living campaign fuel.

---

## What BLACK LEDGER is not

BLACK LEDGER is **not** a VTT replacement.

It does not need to move tokens, roll dice, or render tactical maps. VTTs can keep doing that.

BLACK LEDGER is **not** an AI GM.

It does not replace the person running the table. It gives GMs structured world pressure, mission ideas, and consequences.

BLACK LEDGER is **not** passive surveillance.

Table Pulse and GOD Observer require consent and do not automatically create world truth.

BLACK LEDGER is **not** pay-to-win.

Premium tools may help create, publish, or organize. They must not buy faction victory or leaderboard rank.

BLACK LEDGER is **not** automatic canon.

User-submitted lore, faction moves, and session summaries need review before they become world state.

---

## What users will want to know

### Can I use BLACK LEDGER for a private home campaign?

Yes. A GM can run a private world, private mission market, and private map without joining a public season.

### Can I use it for a living community?

Yes. That is one of the best use cases: multiple GMs, shared city state, open runs, approved rule environments, seasonal honors, and public-safe news.

### Can players submit their own lore?

Yes, with review. Players can submit intel, rumors, district lore, and unresolved hooks. GMs or world operators decide what becomes real.

### Can I control a megacorp?

In advanced or seasonal modes, yes. Faction seats can let trusted users operate corps or factions and generate pressure for GMs.

### Does the GM lose control?

No. BLACK LEDGER suggests missions and consequences. GMs adopt, edit, reject, and resolve.

### Can it schedule sessions?

Yes. Runs can connect to scheduling tools like Lunacal, then hand off to Discord, Teams, or another meeting surface.

### Does it record sessions?

Not by default. Any Table Pulse Aftermath or GOD Observer integration is opt-in, consent-gated, and review-based.

### Do run results affect future missions?

Yes. That is the point. Completed runs feed world ticks, which update heat, districts, factions, mission seeds, news, and future opportunities.

### Can BLACK LEDGER generate news?

Yes. Approved world events can become news tickers, faction newsletters, player recaps, and campaign bulletins.

### Can I opt out of public exposure?

Yes. Worlds, campaigns, runners, intel, and recaps need visibility controls: private, campaign-only, GM-only, faction-secret, network-visible, or public-safe.

## The first version

The first proof should be small and strong:

**Seattle Tick 001**

* one city map
* five districts
* three factions
* one GM-only mission market
* a handful of intel reports
* a few planned runs
* one scheduled open run
* one completed run
* one world tick
* one newsreel
* one faction newsletter
* one runner legend moment

Success looks like this:

> A GM opens the map, adopts a job, schedules a session, runs it, reports the result, and sees the world change.

That is the minimum magic.

---

## The vision

BLACK LEDGER is the leap from “campaign manager” to **living Shadowrun world**.

It makes Chummer more than the place where your runner sheet lives.

It becomes the place where:

* factions scheme
* GMs find jobs
* players join runs
* runners become legends
* intel becomes opportunity
* sessions become consequences
* news tells the story
* the city changes

**BLACK LEDGER is where the shadows remember.**
