# JACKPOINT

## The problem

Players and GMs want dossiers, recaps, primers, and narrated briefings, but most content tools either invent details or strip away where the facts came from.

## What it would do

JACKPOINT would turn approved session material into dossiers, recaps, narrated briefings, evidence rooms, share cards, and creator packs.
It is the short-to-medium-form publishing studio, not a replacement for full books.

## Likely owners

* `chummer6-hub`
* `chummer6-hub-registry`
* `chummer6-media-factory`

## Key tool posture

* `MarkupGo` - document/render adapter lane
* `vidBoard` - structured presenter-video and multilingual briefing lane
* `Soundmadeseen` - narrated recap and briefing media lane
* `Unmixr AI` - candidate voice lane until proven
* `PeekShot` - preview/share-card adapter
* `Documentation.AI` - downstream docs/help projection
* `Paperguide` - cited grounding helper
* `Mootion` - bounded video support
* `First Book ai` - bounded overflow support when the artifact lane needs long-form carryover

## What has to be true first

* a fact trail that survives formatting
* approval states
* registry and media working together cleanly
* source classification
* reliable publication workflows

## Current proof posture

JACKPOINT is still a horizon, but it is no longer only prose.
The public artifact registry already carries first-party preview shapes for dossier briefs and mission-brief video lanes so the publication move stays inspectable before the full studio is promoted.
The signed-in command lane is already live at `https://chummer.run/jackpoint`.
That lane currently carries first-party briefing packets on real markdown and JSON routes without pretending the whole long-form publishing roadmap is done.

## Why it is not ready yet

These outputs only matter if the evidence path survives writing, narration, preview generation, and publication.
Until that chain is reliable, Chummer should not sell the studio as ready.
