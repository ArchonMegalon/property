# Public landing policy

## Purpose

`chummer.run` is the public product homepage, proof shelf, and invitation surface for Chummer.
It is not the docs site, not a repo index, and not a second design authority.

`Chummer6` remains the richer downstream explainer and guide.
`chummer6-design` remains the canonical source.

## Public promise

The landing surface must let a normal person understand, in one visit:

* what Chummer is
* what is real today
* what is coming next
* what they can do right now
* what changes when they sign in

## Hard rules

* `chummer.run` is product-facing, not repo-facing.
* Public landing copy must not lead with repo jargon, pipeline jargon, or architecture sermon language.
* Provider names and LTD names are implementation details and must not be named on the landing page.
* Empty placeholder boxes are forbidden.
* If a feature is not live, the card must still explain what is coming and why it matters.
* Public guest chrome must expose `Sign in` plus one primary acquisition action.
* Public cards must not self-link back to the same route unless they are explicitly marked as non-clickable teasers.
* External exits must be explicit and labeled as fallbacks or guide links, not disguised as first-party defaults.
* Landing meaning must compile from design-owned manifest and registry data rather than hub-local improvisation.
* Public maturity, install, and update language must stay converged across `chummer.run`, `Chummer6`, and any linked release repo README or guide page.
* Public status is advisory and explanatory; it does not overrule canonical design truth.
* Provider names may appear only on dedicated auth and account-security surfaces, not on the landing hero or proof cards.
* Download-facing copy and CTA labels must follow `PUBLIC_DOWNLOADS_POLICY.md` and `PUBLIC_AUTO_UPDATE_POLICY.md`.
* Client acquisition must route through `chummer.run`; GitHub may link to source or to `chummer.run`, but it must not host public client binaries as the download path.
* Proof-shelf language is scoped to posted files, named flows, and recent checks a person can inspect today; it must not silently upgrade a preview lane into a flagship claim.
* Fallback heads, archive packages, manual commands, and recovery routes must read as bounded compatibility, backup, or recovery paths rather than equal defaults.
* Artifact-factory explainers, preview cards, captions, packet siblings, and proof-gallery artifacts may deepen inspection, but they must not be framed as the recommended install path, the authority over the install shelf, or as proof that the whole product is flagship-ready.

## Surface split

`chummer.run` owns:

* homepage / product front door
* public proof shelf
* public progress report
* current-state summary
* coming-next summary
* participate entry route
* signed-in home overlay

`Chummer6` owns:

* deeper human explainer copy
* richer examples
* horizon walkthroughs
* public help/support framing

The landing page should route people into `Chummer6` when they want more explanation, not try to replace the guide entirely.

## Public versus registered

Public visitors may access:

* `/`
* `/what-is-chummer`
* `/now`
* `/horizons`
* `/downloads`
* `/progress`
* `/participate`
* `/status`
* `/artifacts`

Registered overlays may unlock:

* `/home`
* `/account`
* horizon follows or watchlists
* beta-interest and waitlist state
* participation / guided-contribution state
* future vote placeholders

The early-access shell may keep registered overlays thin, but the split must be visible and canonical.

## CTA rule

The landing page must always provide at least these public actions:

* one primary acquisition action such as `Open downloads` or `Request early access`
* one proof action such as `See what works today`
* participate / help
* sign in

## Flow rule

The landing page should read in this order:

* value
* proof
* fit
* access

It should not read like a route index.

## Proof rule

The landing page must prove something real exists now.

Allowed proof surfaces include:

* current-state cards
* release shelf entries
* public featured artifacts
* public status summaries
* grounded horizon cards that clearly say `horizon`, `preview`, `guided preview`, or `available today`

Those surfaces may prove what is posted, inspectable, or recently checked today.
They must not treat artifact-factory siblings, preview cards, or fallback routes as automatic proof of flagship readiness.
They must not let a posted proof card, teaser artifact, explainer bundle, or packet sibling outrank the actual install shelf for a platform.

The release shelf should feel like an install-and-update shelf first and an archive list second.
It must present one obvious recommended default per platform before exposing advanced alternatives.

The release shelf should feel like an install-and-update shelf first and an archive list second.

## Participation wording

Use public language such as:

* participate
* guided contribution
* temporary help lane

Do not lead with operator terms like:

* participant burst lane
* jury lane
* worker topology
* Fleet
* device-code auth
* worker host

Those terms may appear only in deeper explainer surfaces where they are necessary.

## Ownership

* `chummer6-design` owns public landing structure, route map, copy constraints, feature visibility, and media briefs.
* `chummer6-hub` owns the hosted projection of that structure on `chummer.run`.
* `chummer6-media-factory` owns landing media generation and provenance.
* `Chummer6` may echo the same posture, but it does not become the landing authority.
* `fleet` may publish or synchronize generated outputs, but it must not become the source of landing meaning.
