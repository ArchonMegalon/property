# External tools plane

## Purpose

Project Chummer has a meaningful owned external-tool inventory.
Those tools are now considered part of the program's integration capability set.

This document defines how Chummer may use those tools for:

* Hub orchestration
* help/docs
* approval routing
* ops dashboards
* user feedback loops
* research/evaluation
* post-session coaching
* media creation
* route visualization
* archive and retention support

without allowing any external tool to become canonical product truth.

`PROVIDER_AND_ROUTE_STEWARDSHIP.md` defines the standing review, canary, promotion, and rollback loop for provider and model defaults inside those bounded routes.

## Core rule

External tools may assist, route, render, summarize, visualize, archive, notify, project, interview, or schedule. They may not become the canonical source of rules truth, session truth, approval truth, registry truth, media truth, notification truth, roster truth, entitlement truth, analytics interpretation truth, or canon truth.

External workbenches may collect operator edits, assignments, review outcomes, and proposed status changes only as Chummer-owned `AdminIntent` inputs. Hub or the relevant canonical service must validate authority, visibility, invariants, and receipts before any canonical write.

Research and interview tools may collect interviews and produce synthesis outputs, but they may not become feature truth, implementation priority, or backlog ownership.

Chummer-owned repos and Chummer-owned manifests/stores remain authoritative.
Owning an LTD does not obligate Chummer to integrate it.
A tool may be promoted, bounded, parked, or explicitly excluded.

## Tool inventory posture

Current known external-tool inventory includes:

* 1min.AI
* Prompting Systems
* ChatPlayground AI
* Soundmadeseen
* vidBoard
* AI Magicx
* FastestVPN PRO
* OneAir
* Headway
* hedy.ai
* Internxt Cloud Storage
* ApiX-Drive
* ApproveThis
* AvoMap
* BrowserAct
* Browserly
* ClickRank
* Crezlo Tours
* Deftform
* Documentation.AI
* Emailit
* FacePop
* First Book ai
* Icanpreneur
* Katteb
* Invoiless
* Lunacal
* MarkupGo
* MetaSurvey
* Mootion
* NextStep
* Nonverbia
* Paperguide
* PeekShot
* ProductLift
* Signitic
* Taja
* Teable
* Unmixr AI
* Vizologi

Current internal posture assumes every listed LTD is redeemed and activated.
Public inventory snapshots may lag that internal state, so activation verification still gates runtime approval.

## Workspace integration tiers versus vendor plan tiers

Product plan tier and Chummer workspace integration tier are not the same thing.

Important current distinctions:

* 1min.AI - workspace integration Tier 1
* BrowserAct - workspace integration Tier 1
* Teable - workspace integration Tier 2, vendor license plan Tier 4
* Emailit - workspace integration Tier 3 until sender-domain, suppression, template, and delivery-receipt gates are complete
* Paperguide - workspace integration Tier 3, vendor license plan Tier 4

Chummer routing, rollout, and architectural ownership should follow workspace integration tier and system-of-record safety rules, not marketing or license-plan tier labels.

## Horizon-facing bounded lanes

Horizons may consume owned LTDs only through bounded capability lanes.
The horizon docs decide whether a lane is active; this document decides which kinds of LTD use are architecturally allowed.

Current horizon-facing posture:

* `jackpoint` - structured presenter-video and multilingual briefing lanes may use `vidBoard`; narrated recap and briefing lanes may use `Soundmadeseen`; bounded candidate voice may use `Unmixr AI`; evidence/capture packets may use `Browserly`
* `black-ledger` - world-tick and faction-war operations may use `Teable` for admin projection and AdminIntent entry, `NextStep` for SOP execution, `ApproveThis` for guest approvals, `Signitic` for passive signature campaigns, `Emailit` for Hub-owned digest and closeout mail, `vidBoard` / `Taja` / `PeekShot` / `MarkupGo` / `Soundmadeseen` for approved artifacts, and first-party map infrastructure for map truth
* `karma-forge` - governed house-rule discovery may use `Icanpreneur` for interviews and synthesis, `Deftform` for pre-screening, `Lunacal` for follow-up clinics, `MetaSurvey` for quant validation, `Teable` for candidate review boards and AdminIntent entry, `NextStep` for sprint/process execution, and bounded `FacePop` / `Signitic` / `Emailit` / `vidBoard` / `Taja` for recruitment, closeout, and approved discovery explainers
* `community-hub` - open-run discovery and scheduling may use `Lunacal`, `Deftform`, `FacePop`, `Teable`, `NextStep`, `MetaSurvey`, `Emailit`, and bounded `Signitic` / `vidBoard` / `Taja` for recruiting, application review, invite delivery, and recap projection; `hedy.ai` and `Nonverbia` may assist GM-private or consent-gated debrief flows only; Discord, Teams, generic meeting URLs, Foundry, Roll20, and comparable play surfaces remain projection-only handoff or export targets and may not own run, roster, consent, or resolution truth
* `runsite` - explorable location artifacts may use `Crezlo Tours`, `AvoMap`, and `PeekShot`; orientation-host clips may use `vidBoard`; optional narration may use `Soundmadeseen`; bounded capture/reference packets may use `Browserly`; route, map, and tour siblings stay first-party inspectable truth and the media layer may not become tactical authority
* `runbook-press` - long-form authoring and export may use `First Book ai`, `MarkupGo`, and `Documentation.AI`; campaign primer and module explainer videos may use `vidBoard`; narrated companion assets may use `Soundmadeseen`; bounded candidate voice or reference capture may use `Unmixr AI` and `Browserly`
* `table-pulse-aftermath` - post-session coaching packets may use `Nonverbia` as the primary analysis lane, `hedy.ai` as the bounded session-structure and debrief helper lane, with later bounded player-safe recap / GM-private debrief video from `vidBoard`, plus bounded narrated/report outputs from `Soundmadeseen`, `Unmixr AI`, `MarkupGo`, and `PeekShot`; this entry governs Table Pulse Aftermath only, not the live world-heat packet rail

## Public trust and concierge posture

Public trust surfaces may consume owned LTDs only through bounded public-concierge lanes that route into first-party Chummer truth.

Current public-surface posture:

* Hub-owned public trust surfaces such as `/downloads`, `/now`, public help entry pages, artifact pages, creator pages, and tokenized invite pages that expose no private truth may use `FacePop` as a bounded public concierge or trust-widget lane
* public intake or guided escalation may use `Deftform` for structured intake and `Lunacal` for human booking only when Chummer-owned fallback paths and receipt mirroring remain intact
* public or network-visible open-run discovery may use `FacePop`, `Deftform`, and `Lunacal` for first contact, application intake, and booking projection only when accepted-roster truth, meeting-handoff truth, and observer-consent truth remain first-party
* community-run play surfaces such as Discord, Teams, Foundry, Roll20, or generic meeting URLs may receive handoff and export packages only when Chummer remains the first-party authority for run, roster, rule-environment, and closeout truth
* passive outreach and recruitment projection may use `Signitic` only when the CTA lands on first-party Chummer pages and any resulting intake still lands in Chummer-owned receipts or routes
* outbound email may use `Emailit` only when Hub owns the notification event, template reference, suppression state, delivery receipt, unsubscribe posture, and user-visible closeout truth
* Emailit is production-eligible only while sender-domain authentication, suppression and unsubscribe policy, bounce handling, template registry, `EmailDeliveryReceipt`, kill switch, and provider-secret handling stay intact on the active lane.
* public concierge flows may use `vidBoard`, `MarkupGo`, `PeekShot`, and `Soundmadeseen` as sibling explainer and artifact lanes, but those companions remain downstream of Chummer-owned release, support, invite, and publication truth
* public feature ideas, votes, roadmap projection, changelog projection, and voter closeout may use `ProductLift` only as a projection of Chummer-owned design, milestone, release, and closeout truth
* public guide readability, SEO, AI-search visibility, and article-draft work may use `Katteb` only against approved source packets; accepted changes must flow upstream into `chummer6-design` or public-guide source registries before generated guide output changes
* public site crawl health, technical SEO, metadata/schema coverage, broken-link checks, internal-link suggestions, and AI-search visibility measurement may use `ClickRank` only as audit and recommendation output; accepted changes still patch Chummer-owned source first

## Classification model

### Class A - Runtime-adjacent orchestration integrations

These may participate in hosted workflows, but only through controlled adapters and receipts.

Examples:

* reasoning provider routes
* approval bridges
* docs/help bridges
* automation bridges
* survey bridges
* route visualization orchestration
* media orchestration
* public-signal intake governance

### Class B - Runtime-adjacent media integrations

These may render or transform artifacts, but only behind media-factory adapters.

Examples:

* document render providers
* preview/thumbnail providers
* image/portrait providers
* narrated audio/video providers
* bounded video providers
* map/route visualization providers
* archive providers

### Class C - Human-ops / projection integrations

These support operators and curators off the hot path.

Examples:

* projection boards
* moderation boards
* support/help desks
* review inboxes
* release dashboards

### Class C1 - Public trust / concierge widgets

These are bounded public-surface widgets that humanize first contact and route visitors into Chummer-owned truth paths without becoming truth themselves.

Examples:

* optional concierge greetings on `/downloads` or `/now`
* public booking wrappers for setup or creator consult lanes
* moderated testimonial capture on public proof or follow-up pages

### Class C2 - Passive outreach projection integrations

These amplify public invitations or release campaigns, but only by routing people toward first-party Chummer destinations.

Examples:

* email-signature CTA campaigns
* passive recruitment banners
* release-campaign link rotations

### Class C3 - Operator process execution integrations

These execute runbooks, closeout loops, or checklist discipline for operators, but they do not become the canonical process truth.

Examples:

* discovery sprint SOP runners
* media publication checklists
* release closeout checklists
* localization or review gates

### Class C4 - Public feedback, roadmap, and changelog projection

These collect and project public demand, visible roadmap posture, changelog entries, and voter closeout notices without becoming roadmap, support, release, or priority truth.

Examples:

* public feature idea boards
* public voting and comments
* public roadmap projection
* changelog projection
* voter notifications backed by Chummer-owned closeout evidence

### Class C5 - Admin projection and intent-entry workbenches

These expose operator queues, dashboards, review boards, and editable projections, but every write-back is an `AdminIntent` that Chummer validates before state changes.

Examples:

* BLACK LEDGER tick control rooms
* intel review queues
* open-run application review boards
* KARMA FORGE candidate triage
* creator-publication queues
* companion line-pack review boards

### Class C6 - Outbound delivery providers

These deliver Chummer-owned lifecycle, digest, invite, and closeout messages. They do not own notification truth, support status, roadmap status, world truth, suppression policy, or analytics interpretation.

Examples:

* claim/install emails
* support closure mail
* open-run invitations and decisions
* BLACK LEDGER world-tick digests
* faction newsletters
* ProductLift voter closeout follow-ups

### Class D - Research / eval / prompt-tooling integrations

These inform product quality, content quality, or design quality, but they do not directly own end-user truth.

Examples:

* evaluation labs
* prompt research
* cited synthesis
* product strategy ideation
* bounded coaching and social-dynamics analysis

### Class D1 - Discovery / interview integrations

These collect adaptive interviews, research intake, or validation loops, but they do not directly own feature truth or implementation priority.

Examples:

* discovery interviews
* follow-up validation calls
* concept-sprint synthesis
* post-cluster ranking surveys

### Class D2 - Public content optimization and AI-search visibility

These audit or draft public-facing explanatory content against approved source packets, but accepted changes must return to Chummer-owned source before publication.

Examples:

* generated-guide readability audits
* public article drafts
* SEO and AI-search visibility recommendations
* title, description, FAQ, and metadata suggestions

### Class D3 - Public site visibility and crawl health

These audit crawlability, metadata, schema, internal links, broken links, search-console signals, and AI-search visibility for public surfaces. They do not own public copy, product claims, release status, roadmap status, support status, or generated-guide output.

Examples:

* technical SEO audits
* Google Search Console keyword opportunity review
* broken-link and duplicate-tag reports
* crawler-access checks
* schema and metadata recommendations
* AI-search visibility measurements

### Class E - Non-product utilities

Useful to the team, but outside the product architecture.

## System-of-record rule

The following remain Chummer-owned:

* rules math
* runtime fingerprints
* explain provenance
* reducer truth
* session event truth
* approval state
* moderation state
* publication state
* install state
* support case state
* crash/bug/feedback intake state
* artifact manifests
* media lifecycle state
* delivery state
* memory/canon state

External tools may receive a prepared request and may return a receipt-bearing result.
They do not become the owner of any of the truths above.

## Universal integration rules

### Rule 1 - adapter-only access

Every external tool sits behind a Chummer-owned adapter.

### Rule 2 - prepared payloads only

External tools receive prepared requests, not raw unrestricted database access.

### Rule 3 - receipt and provenance required

Anything that re-enters Chummer from an external tool must carry:

* provider identity
* route or adapter class
* request or plan hash
* created-at timestamp
* source refs where applicable
* moderation/safety result where applicable
* Chummer-side correlation id

### Rule 4 - kill switch required

Every integration must be disableable without corrupting product truth.

### Rule 5 - no client-side vendor coupling on authenticated or truth-bearing surfaces

No browser, mobile, or desktop repo may embed vendor credentials or rely on vendor SDKs on authenticated, truth-bearing, or runtime-critical surfaces.

This includes:

* signed-in home surfaces
* campaign workspace
* support case views
* install/update flows
* crash/bug submission forms
* desktop/mobile runtime UX
* admin/operator surfaces

### Rule 5a - public concierge widget exception

A bounded external widget may appear on a Hub-owned public surface only when all of the following are true:

* the surface is public, low-risk, and not the owner of canonical truth
* the widget is optional and removable via kill switch
* fixed first-party route truth stays visible without the widget
* preview language stays visibly secondary to the first-party route or status surface
* the widget has a graceful first-party fallback path
* recovery posture routes into first-party help, relinking, or escalation copy instead of treating the widget as the recovery mechanism
* no vendor secret or private access token is exposed client-side
* the widget does not become the system of record for support, install, auth, publication, or campaign truth
* every meaningful submission or route result is mirrored back into Chummer-owned receipts or first-party destinations
* accessibility and locale review are complete

### Rule 6 - archive is not canon

Vendor-hosted copies or vendor-side asset persistence are never the canonical archive.
Canonical manifests remain Chummer-owned.

### Rule 7 - activation is not trust

A redeemed or activated tool is merely eligible for integration.
It is not automatically approved for canonical runtime use.

### Rule 8 - coaching analysis is opt-in and post-session only

Any tool that analyzes human session behavior must stay opt-in, post-session, and clearly separate from canonical session truth, moderation truth, or player discipline.

### Rule 9 - support assistant is not phase 0

The first support plane must work without a chat assistant or support widget.

Crash reporting, structured bug reporting, and lightweight feedback must be first-class Chummer-owned flows before any support assistant becomes user-facing.
No new AppSumo LTD is required or assumed for the core crash path.

### Rule 9a - concierge widgets may route to support; they may not replace support

A public concierge widget may:

* help the user choose between help paths
* route to Deftform or Hub support intake
* route to Lunacal for human escalation
* show a short human greeting or explainer

A public concierge widget may not:

* claim to resolve support cases itself
* become the support ticket or case record
* hide the first-party support path
* block access to first-party support when disabled
* present fallback or manual install routes as the recommended path through warmer copy
* claim that a fix is already available for this user when the first-party release or support receipt does not say so

## Allowed and forbidden public concierge surfaces

Allowed:

* public landing pages
* `/downloads`
* `/now`
* public help entry pages
* public artifact and creator pages
* tokenized invite pages that expose no private truth

Forbidden:

* desktop app
* mobile app
* signed-in home
* authenticated campaign workspace
* updater dialogs
* claim-code entry forms
* case timeline and support-thread views
* admin, governor, or operator surfaces

## Activation verification rule

Because these tools are owned and assumed available, the gating rule changes from redemption gating to activation verification gating.

A tool may be architecturally planned, but it is not runtime-approved until:

* the owning repo is assigned
* the adapter boundary is defined
* the Chummer receipt model exists
* the kill switch exists
* the provenance model exists
* fallback behavior exists
* secrets handling is defined
* the integration is reflected in milestones

Add:

* `ProviderRouteReceipt`
* `ProviderRouteRef`

## Release-gate rule

No external integration reaches production use until:

* adapter exists
* Chummer receipt exists
* Chummer kill switch exists
* Chummer provenance rules exist
* system-of-record rule is preserved
* owning repo is explicit
* milestone rollout is published
* client-side secret exposure is impossible
